SNAKE_GAME
=================================================================================================================================
Game Summary - 
A snake is trapped inside a box and we control the snake to eat food in order to score points. As snake eats food its length increases and the speed of motion increases too. The game ends if snake hits the wall or bites its own body.

Controls -
